# Python-RegEx
A regular expression is a powerful tool for matching text, based on a pre-defined pattern. It can detect the presence or absence of a text by matching with a particular pattern, and also can split a pattern into one or more sub-patterns. The Python standard library provides a re module for regular expressions. Its primary function is to offer a search, where it takes a regular expression and a string.
